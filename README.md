# svhl/scripts

Scripts I use that I couldn't find anywhere else. Some are modified from others' scripts.

## Scripts

#### [logout](https://github.com/svhl/scripts/tree/main/logout.sh)
Prevent a logout app icon from sometimes appearing in the taskbar on KDE Plasma when calling the logout screen with ctrl+alt+del. Tested on Plasma 5.27.

#### [vim](https://github.com/svhl/scripts/tree/main/vim)

Automatically use sudo when opening root-owned files and prevent you from vimming into directories. Based on [vim-auto-sudo](https://github.com/n3b0j5a/vim-auto-sudo).

## How to use

Make scripts executable with `chmod +x [script]`. Move wrapper scripts to `~/.local/bin/`.
