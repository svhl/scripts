Scripts I use that I couldn't find anywhere else. Some are modified from others' scripts.

## Scripts

#### [logout](https://github.com/svhl/scripts/tree/main/logout.sh)
**KDE only.** Prevent a logout app icon from sometimes appearing in the taskbar when calling the logout screen with ctrl+alt+del. Tested on Plasma 5.27.

## How to use

`chmod +x ./*.sh`
